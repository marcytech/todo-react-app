App created in the training I did in Matheus Battisti's course, a well-known React JS specialist.

## What I learned developing this app

- Create components
- Instantiate components inside others
- Styling components with CSS
- styled-components (CSS in JS)
- Basic React Hooks
- Work with Rest API's and the HTTP protocol
   - Get
   - Post
   - Put
   - Delete

## What I most enjoyed doing here

I had already tried to understand how hooks and components worked by reading and watching other videos. But with the help of this video I finally understood the whole flow and concepts involved.

Pure happiness!!!

## ToDo React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
<!-- @import "[TOC]" {cmd="toc" depthFrom=1 depthTo=6 orderedList=false} -->

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
